<p>Instead of making something locally using Stable Diffusion as I usually do, I figured this challenge would probably go best with Dall-E 3, due to its advanced prompt following skills (well, so long as you don't offend its tender sensibilities anyway).</p>
<p>Here was my first go, which was really an accident as I hit enter before I really got anywhere with it ðŸ˜€</p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/2Q.png" alt="" width="512" height="512" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/responsive/2Q-xs.png 300w ,https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/responsive/2Q-sm.png 480w ,https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/responsive/2Q-md.png 768w ,https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/responsive/2Q-lg.png 1024w ,https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/responsive/2Q-xl.png 1360w ,https://halr9000.com/media/posts/3/responsive/2Q-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption >On one fine misty spring morning, I took a walkaboutÂ </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But here is the real deal, which I was quite pleased with. Check out the poem below the image.</p>

<figcaption >A poetic mech</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And the poetic prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On one fine misty spring morning, I took a walkabout<br>Still in my silvered battle mech armor, atop my black firesuit <br>A silly sight my slim figure made, looking into the distance <br>Â  Â  with a carpet bag over my shoulder!</p>
<p>The trail ends at the grassy shore of a curving brook, edged with rocks big and small</p>
<p>A welcoming sight in the distance! This ancient Chinese traveler <br>may soon find her rest for the eve</p>
<p>I am met with two rustic buildings, perhaps a tavern and a farmhouse?</p>
<p>The eaves under the upturned roof are beckoning to me</p>
<p>The porch seems to have a chair with my name carved on it</p>
<p>The bushes near, the mountains afar -- I am home</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm no master of meter, but this did the trick for me.</p>

  <p>
    "Put your face in any style" is the claim made by the authors of the paper titled:&nbsp;<a href="https://instantid.github.io/">InstantID : Zero-shot Identity-Preserving Generation in Seconds</a>. You don't have to know what this means, as the team spent a lot of time providing examples and comparisons to previous techniques. This stuff moves so fast -- I was evaluating one of them the day before writing this article, which had also been recently introduced!&nbsp;<br>
  </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      Our model supports identity-preserving generation in high fidelity with only single reference image in any style.<br>
<br>We can achieve competitive results as LoRAs without any training.
    </blockquote>

  <p>
    Expect to see even more "face cloning" or "selfie styling" apps and services and features over the next few months. This stuff was already possible for most of a year, but you really needed many photos, careful preparation, and a lot of expensive GPU time to do it well. Not anymore. I have this running on my PC now, takes 30 seconds on my mid-range GPU.
<br>
<br>There's definitely two sides to this, as with most anything.
  </p>

  <p class="msg msg--warning">
    We are now at the point that you should not blindly trust photographic evidence without additional context or other verifiable measures!&nbsp;<br>
